👁️ OpenCV-Basics
Welcome to the OpenCV-Basics repository! This project serves as a comprehensive starter guide for mastering computer vision concepts using the powerful OpenCV library.

🎯 Project Goals
The main objective of this repository is to bridge the gap between theoretical image processing and practical application. By the end of this module, you will be able to:

Master the Core: Understand the fundamental structures of the OpenCV library.

Build AI Tools: Develop your own Real-time Face Detection program.

Process Media: Gain hands-on experience with both static image processing and dynamic video streams.

Refine Visuals: Apply advanced image filtering techniques to enhance or transform data.

🛠️ Key Features
1. Image & Video Handling
Learn how to read, write, and display media from various sources, including local files and live webcam feeds.

2. Image Processing Tools
Explore the essential toolkit for computer vision:

Color Space Conversions (e.g., RGB to Grayscale, HSV)

Geometric Transformations (Scaling, Rotation, Blur)

Thresholding & Binarization

3. Image Filtering & Smoothing
Deep dive into mathematical kernels used to manipulate pixels:

Blurring: Gaussian, Median, and Bilateral filtering.

Edge Detection: Using Canny edge operators.

4. Face Detection
Implement the Haar Cascade classifier or DNN-based methods to identify human faces within a frame.
